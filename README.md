  <h1>Fabricators Public Access License (FPAL)</h1>
  <p>This repository contains the official text, header, and supporting materials for the <b>Fabricators Public Access License (FPAL) v1.0</b>.</p>
</div>

## Purpose

FPAL was created to address a specific need: enabling public code access, collaboration, and transparency without exposing core product concepts and business models to replication or exploitation. While inspired by open source principles, FPAL is not an OSI-approved license and includes specific limitations on use to protect the identity, integrity, and sustainability of the licensed project.

This license allows anyone to:

* Inspect and audit the source code
* Use and modify it for educational and non-commercial purposes
* Contribute improvements back to the project
* Build derivative software for unrelated purposes

However, it restricts the use of the software to create or operate substantially similar products or services that replicate the licensed project's core function or business intent.

## License Header

To indicate use of FPAL in source files, add the following header:

```txt
Copyright (c) 2025 FABRICATORS S.R.L.
Licensed under the Fabricators Public Access License (FPAL) v1.0
See https://github.com/fabricatorsltd/FPAL for details.

## License Badge

## Usage
